# SuperdEye

SuperdEye is the implementation of TartarusGate by trickster0 in pure Go and Go Assembler.

The purpose is to scan hooked NTDLL and retreive the Syscall number to then do an indirect Syscall with it, thus allowing the bypass of AV/EDR that put hooks on functions.

## Side Story: Why the name SuperdEye

In [Mushoku Tensei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu) the Superd is a tribal Demonic Race from the Demon Continent. They have green emerald Hair and a third Eye on their forehead that let them perceive mana not detectable by others.

The superd tribe are hated by Demons and Human alike due to historical reason. A Superd is hated and feared for just being a Superd.

I named this project SuperdEye as it let you perceive syscall number and do indirect syscall, much like having a Superd Eye will let you detect mana and fight the enemy.
